I probably could tell you what micro-operations a given x86 instruction decodes to on any recent or older CPU if woken up in the middle of the night.</p><p>I don't really <em>like</em> any of the programming languages I've had the (mis)fortune of working with, of which there are many, as every extant language is inevitably flawed in multiple ways, in part due to working on similarly — if not moreso — flawed hardware; nevertheless, I do appreciate some of the <em>ideas</em> behind some languages, such as Lisp or Rust, if not the actual languages themselves.</p><p>I used to be pretty active in the Emacs community, so <a href="https://github.com/Fanael/">my GitHub profile</a> is dominated by my Emacs packages. I'm no longer as active due to health issues, but I still use Emacs a lot.</p><p>I'm also a non-binary person, preferred third person pronouns she/her.</p></section><section id="about-blog"><h2>About the blog<a class="section-header-link" href="#about-blog" aria-label="anchor">§</a></h2><p>On this blog I will cover any programming, computer science, and software engineering topics that strike my fancy, including, but not limited do, low-level optimization, design and implementation of tracing garbage collectors, and other topics I deem interesting.</p><p>Since I'm a strong believer in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free software</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-culture_movement">free culture</a> in general, all contents on this website are licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/" rel="license">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>.
