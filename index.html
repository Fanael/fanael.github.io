Why not have a look at them?</p><aside><p>I've been writing another, more substantial and much larger article for quite some time. I initially wanted to publish it in December, then January, then March, but getting it into a shape I'm comfortable with takes much more time and effort than I anticipated. Sorry about that.</p></aside><p>The big, immediately noticeable change is that the <a href="/">main page</a> is no longer a copy of the latest article. I've changed it to the tried and true format of using the introductory section of the last several articles, where "several" is defined here as five.</p><p>With that change, the need for displaying an article permalink in the header vanished: since pages aren't getting copied anymore, there's no need for an explicit, unambiguous, canonical link to an article. The address the browser displays when you read an article <em>is</em> now the canonical link, putting one in the article header as well would just be superfluous.</p><p>While the other changes are minor and not as readily — if at all — noticeable to most readers, they still warrant coverage, in their own subsections.</p><a class="read-full" href="/blog-update.html" aria-label="Read the full article: Blog update">Read the full article…</a></article><article id="stockfish-on-windows-98"><header><h2><a href="/stockfish-on-windows-98.html">Current Stockfish on Windows 98?!</a></h2><p>Published on the <time datetime="2020-09-24">24th of September 2020</time></p><p>Topics: <a href="/archives/topic-retro.html">retro</a>, <a href="/archives/topic-windows-9x.html">windows-9x</a></p></header><p>A few weeks ago I had this weird idea: would it be possible to make an up-to-date version of <a href="https://stockfishchess.org/">Stockfish</a> run on Windows 98? There's an immediate problem with that: Stockfish is written in C++17, which is the still-current, at the time of writing, revision of the C++ language; surely there are no C++17 capable compilers that can still target something as old as Windows 98?</p><div class="note"><p>Disclaimer: in this article, by "Windows 98" I mean Windows 98 second edition with the main files of the <a href="https://www.techtalk.cc/viewtopic.php?t=65">unofficial service pack</a> installed, which is a convenient bundle of official and unofficial patches. I don't care about Windows 98 first edition, nor the second edition <em>without</em> those updates installed. Note that <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/kernelex/">KernelEx</a> is <em>not needed</em>.</p><p>I'm fully aware this has no practical value, but it was a fun thing to do.</p></div><p>As it turns out, the GNU toolchain, comprised of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/">GNU binutils</a> and <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection</a>, doesn't particularly care about all the different Windows versions and will happily output a binary that works on any 32-bit Windows.</p><p>The compiler itself, assembler and linker are only a part of a functional compiler package, though. There's one part we're missing: the runtime library, which provides the system-specific program initialization code that runs before the <code>main</code> function. Since we're using GCC, the obvious choice is the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/">mingw-w64</a> runtime. It also provides Windows API headers, bindings to (pretty much all the extant versions of) the Microsoft Visual C++ standard C library, and a POSIX threading API compatibility layer, <cite class="program-name">winpthreads</cite>, which is required for C++ standard threading library support in GCC.</p><p>Fortunately for us, a minimal Windows program compiled with GCC with mingw-w64 appears to work fine when executed under Windows 98:</p><pre class="codeblock" data-code-language="C++"><code><span class="c-c">#</span><span class="c-c">include</span> <span class="c-c">&lt;windows.h&gt;</span><span class="c-c">
</span>
<span class="c-k">int</span> WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE, HINSTANCE, <span class="c-k">char</span>*, <span class="c-k">int</span>)
{
    MessageBoxA(<span class="c-k">nullptr</span>, <span class="c-s">"</span><span class="c-s">Hello world!</span><span class="c-s">"</span>, <span class="c-s">"</span><span class="c-s">A test</span><span class="c-s">"</span>, MB_OK);
    <span class="c-k">return</span> <span class="c-m">0</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>So maybe all we have to do is to compile Stockfish and it will just work on Windows 98…?</p><a class="read-full" href="/stockfish-on-windows-98.html" aria-label="Read the full article: Current Stockfish on Windows 98?!">Read the full article…</a></article><article id="is-x86-risc-internally"><header><h2><a href="/is-x86-risc-internally.html">The legend of "x86 CPUs decode instructions into RISC form internally"</a></h2><p>Published on the <time datetime="2020-06-30">30th of June 2020</time></p><p>Topics: <a href="/archives/topic-microarchitectural-musings.html">microarchitectural-musings</a>, <a href="/archives/topic-mythbusting.html">mythbusting</a></p></header><p>There is a widespread idea that modern high-performance x86 processors work by decoding the "complex" x86 instructions into "simple" RISC-like instructions that the rest of the pipeline then operates on.
