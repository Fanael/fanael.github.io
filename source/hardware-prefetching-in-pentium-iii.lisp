  :description "Determining the existence and discovering the basic characteristics of the hardware prefetcher in Pentium III"
  :date (2019 10 25)
  :children (test results conclusion)
  (p "Nowadays pretty much every processor featuring cache hierarchy has some form of automatic memory prefetch mechanism. In small low-power processors it may be very simplistic and only prefetch if the addresses are increasing, in high-performance processors it may try to predict all sorts of regular and semi-regular patterns, but the basic mechanism "
     (em "will be")
     " present in some form.")
  (p "We weren't, however, always so lucky. The first mainstream x86 processor with hardware prefetching logic was the Pentium 4 Willamette, first released in November 2000, which used the highly contentious NetBurst microarchitecture. Due to Willamette's mediocrity, Intel didn't kill off their older P6 microarchitecture, and so the hardware prefetching was later supposedly added to the P6-based Pentium III Tualatin (released in June 2001), where its efficacy was disputed due to much lower CPU-chipset bandwidth compared to NetBurst.")
  (aside
   (p "The P6 microarchitecture introduced in Pentium Pro, in 1995, and used with minor changes in Pentium II and III, is a direct ancestor of Intel's current high-performance x86 microarchitectures â€” at the time of writing, Ice Like for mobile, Skylake for everything else. There were many improvements in the last 24 years, and most major bottlenecks were fixed, but the family resemblance is still there.")
   (p "P6's direct successor was Pentium M, created for mobile processors due to NetBurst's high power draw rendering it unsuitable for those applications. The Core microarchitecture powering the famous Core 2 series, that let Intel take the performance crown back from AMD after years of humiliation due to their marketing-driven, physics-ignoring bet on NetBurst, was a direct successor of Pentium M."))
  (p "But how effective was the hardware prefetching in Tualatin, really? And is it really true that Coppermine, the Pentium III revision preceding Tualatin, didn't feature automatic prefetching? Fortunately, by choosing an appropriate test case and using CPU performance counters, it is possible to perform a gray-box test that answers these questions."))

  (p "The thing I want to test is whether or not Pentium III's prefetcher, if existent and effective, can handle accessing memory linearly with large variable strides. The first algorithm with such an access pattern that came to my mind was "

     (em "why")
     " it is slow: the out-of-order engine is full, but instructions cannot retire because they're still waiting on memory accesses to complete (as there are no other significant sources of stalls in this program), which stalls the front-end too. Heap sort stalls a lot because it's heap sort; Shell sort stalls a lot, albeit a bit less, because with large gap sizes, at least until they get small enough to resemble insertion sort cache-wise, the program performs lots of memory accesses to far away addresses that either haven't had a chance to get into cache yet, or have already been evicted to make room for newer ones, and there's no prefetching to do it ahead-of-time."))

  (p "This test shows that the legends are true. Coppermine doesn't have automatic hardware prefetching, and thus presumably Katmai and older P6 processors don't either. It was introduced in a limited, but functional, form in Tualatin: hardware prefetching only works for ascending addresses, and is limited by slow memory interface, but can handle variable strides, and even the undocumented performance events appear to function correctly."))
